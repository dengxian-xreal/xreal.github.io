# Overview

### What you'll build

In this codelab, you'll build a simple game using NRSDK. The goal of the game is to collect gem using a vehicle that you control using your controller.

However, this won't happen in an entirely virtual world! You'll mix physical atoms and digital bits to create a new type of player experience by creating a game that understands the environment around the player.

By the end of this tutorial, your game will be able to:

- Detect real-world planes and draw a playing field over it.
- Cast rays from controller and detect intersections with planes.

### What you'll learn

- How to set up a project that uses NRSDK
- How to use `PlaneDetector`to subscribe to new planes.
- How to use `Raycast` to find intersections with virtual geometry

### What you'll need

Please refer to Step 1 to Step 5 in [Getting Started with NRSDK](../02_Getting%20Started%20with%20NRSDK.mdd) to get your environment ready for development.
