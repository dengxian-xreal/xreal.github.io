# Mapping Example Scene

## MappingExample

The Mapping Example scene is a part of an SDK that provides an interactive demonstration of working with Spatial Anchors. The experience enables users to create, place, save, and reload anchors within the augmented reality environment.

To access the "MappingExample" scene, follow these steps:

1. After importing the SDK package into your Unity project, navigate to the "Scenes" folder in the Project window.
2. Locate and open the "MappingExample" scene.
3. Explore the scene hierarchy and components to understand how the `AnchorItem` script is used.
4. Run the scene in the Unity Editor or build it for your device to see the Spatial Anchor functionality in action.

### Experience Flow

<img src="https://pub-8dffc52979c34362aa2dbe3a43f0792a.r2.dev/anchor.gif"/>

**1.Opening the Anchor Panel** 

After entering the MappingExample scene, users can click the OpenAnchorPanel button to reveal the Anchor panel.

**2.Selecting and Placing an Anchor** 

Three anchor options will appear. Users can select any of these anchors using a hand-held controller and then position the anchor in a specific location within the real world.

**3.Scanning the Surroundings** 

Before saving the anchor, users are advised to observe the surroundings by simply looking around while wearing the headset. This step ensures that sufficient feature points are collected, enhancing the stability and accuracy of the anchor. During the process, the quality indicator will distribute some capsules evenly around the anchor. The capsules represent the quality of the feature points in different directions around the anchor.

> The color of the capsules indicates the quality:
>
> - ðŸŸ¥ Red: Low quality
> - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: Medium quality
> - ðŸŸ© Green: High quality
>
> When the process is successfully complete, the capsules will all turn to green, which indicates that the anchor is now ready to be used.

**4.Saving the Anchor** 

Once sufficient feature points have been gathered, users can click Save. Successful saving turns the anchor green, signaling that it has been anchored to that location in the real world.

**5.Exiting and Reopening the Application** 

Users may exit the application and reopen it at any time.

**6.Loading the Anchor** 

After reopening the application, clicking Load will reload the previously saved anchor. By returning to the physical location where the anchor was originally placed, users can observe the anchor successfully loading back into the scene.

### Creating Spatial Anchors with NRSDK

**1. Create a NRWorldAnchor object**

- Create a GameObject in the Unity scene.
- Add the NRWorldAnchor component to the GameObject.
- Set the necessary properties, such as UserDefinedKey.

**2. Create the anchor**

Call the `NRWorldAnchor.CreateAnchor()` method. This method takes the current position and rotation of the GameObject as the position and rotation of the anchor. NRSDK will create the anchor asynchronously and eventually notify the application of the creation result through the OnTrackingChanged event.

**3. Estimating the mapping quality**

> **Note:**
>
> The `NRWorldAnchor.SetEstimateRange()` method is deprecated since NRSDK 2.3.1. Now, you can directly call the `NRWorldAnchorStore.UpdateMapQuality()` method to estimate the mapping quality of the anchor during creation. If you want to guide users to observe the anchor within a specified range, you can set the `angle range` in the `Map Quality Indicator` component.

<img src="https://pub-8dffc52979c34362aa2dbe3a43f0792a.r2.dev/image-20240925200344421.png"/>

Call the `NRWorldAnchor.SetEstimateRange()` method. This medthod allows you to set the observation angle and distance used for estimating the mapping quality. The observation angle refers to the range of the area around the anchor that needs to be observed. The observation distance refers to the distance between the observer and the anchor.

```
    public enum NREstimateDistance
    {
        NR_ESTIMATE_DISTANCE_UNKNOWN = 0,
        NR_ESTIMATE_DISTANCE_NEAR = 1, //0~0.5m
        NR_ESTIMATE_DISTANCE_MEDIUM = 2, //0.5~1.5m
        NR_ESTIMATE_DISTANCE_FAR = 3 // 1.5m~2.5m
    }
```

Call the `NRWorldAnchorStore.UpdateMapQuality() `method to estimate the mapping quality of the anchor during creating. This method will return an NREstimateQuality value indicating the current mapping quality.

**4. Save the anchor**

Call the `NRWorldAnchor.SaveAnchor()` method after the anchor is created successfully. This method saves the information and related metadata of the anchor as a file to the device storage.

**5. Use the anchor**

Call the `NRWorldAnchorStore.LoadwithUUID` method to load a saved anchor. The application can use the NRWorldAnchor.UUID to identify and reference a specific anchor. After loading is successful, the application can get the position and rotation of the anchor and use it for AR experiences.

> Things to note:
>
> - Creating an anchor takes time, and the application should handle the creation result in the OnTrackingChanged event.
> - The application should save the anchor at the appropriate time, such as before the user leaves the AR experience.
> - The application should check the CurrentAnchorState of the anchor before using it to make sure the anchor is available.
> - The mapping quality may change over time as the environment changes, and the application should continuously monitor the quality and update the indicator.

### NRWorldAnchorStore Class

The `NRWorldAnchorStore` class manages the storage, creation, and retrieval of spatial anchors, known as `NRWorldAnchor`, within an application. It provides a unified interface for handling anchors, including tracking their states, saving them to persistent storage, and retrieving them as required.

The class is highly tailored to work with the underlying native mapping system and the Unity editor, as seen by the conditional compilation directives. It manages the anchors' lifecycle, ensures their persistence across sessions, and facilitates their efficient retrieval and updates.

### **Loading Spatial Anchor**

In the `MappingExample`, special care is required when loading previously saved Spatial Anchors in the subsequent Session. The Anchor to be loaded (referred to as `AnchorItem` in the example) must exist in the scene, and its key value must be consistent with the key value at the time of saving. Even though the active state of the AnchorItem should be false, or the GameObject placed at a great distance beyond the Camera's display range to ensure it is not visible, it is essential that the AnchorItem be present in the scene.

The logic behind this requirement lies within `LocalMapExample.cs`. During scene initialization, the method `FindObjectsOfType<AnchorItem>()` is employed to find all `AnchorItem` objects within the scene and assign them to `m_AnchorPrefabDict`. This dictionary is further utilized to reinstantiate the actual `AnchorItem` objects appearing in the scene.

Here's a part of the code that demonstrates this:

```
private void Start()
{
    var anchorItems = FindObjectsOfType<AnchorItem>();
    foreach (var item in anchorItems)
    {
        item.OnAnchorItemClick += OnAnchorItemClick;
        m_AnchorPrefabDict.Add(item.key, item.gameObject);
    }
    ...
}
```
