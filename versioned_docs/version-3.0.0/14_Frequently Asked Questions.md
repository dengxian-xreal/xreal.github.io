#### **5 URP Project**

1. Install URP package

	1.	Open Unity Editor.
	2.	Enter Menu Window > Package Manager.
	3.	In Package Manager, search for Universal RP or Universal Render Pipeline.
	4.	Click Install to install the URP package.

2. Create and configure URP render pipeline assets

	1.	Right-click any folder in the Project window and select:
Create > Rendering > URP Asset (with Universal Renderer).
	â€¢	This will generate two files: URP Asset and Renderer Asset.
	2.	Open Edit > Project Settings > Graphics, set the Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings field to the URP Asset you just created.
	3.	Enter Edit > Project Settings > Quality, for each quality setting (e.g., Low, Medium, High), set the Render Pipeline Asset to your URP Asset.

3. Update materials to URP

URP uses different Shaders than Built-in, so materials need to be updated.

Find the materials that need to be updated (displayed as pink) in the project, select them one by one by holding down the command key.

 	1.	Select Menu Edit > Rendering >Materials > Convert Selected Built-in Materials to URP
