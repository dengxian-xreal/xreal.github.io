# Controller

This guide will show you how to use the **XREAL Light controller** and **XREAL phone controller**. The tutorial will demonstrate how to create apps using controllers as an interaction model.

Controllers provide a simple way for users to navigate in mixed reality. In the latest version, NRSDK supports two types of controlling methods: **XREAL Light controller** and **XREAL phone controller**. The XREAL Light controller can be paired with a XREAL Light computing unit or a mobile phone through Bluetooth. The XREAL phone controller is only available when using the phone as XREAL Light's computing unit.
