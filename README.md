# NRSDK Documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

1. Git clone this repo

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and go to this project directory.

3. Install Docusaurus

```
npm install
```

4. Use the following command to start the Docusaurus Development Server:

```
npm run start
```

This will launch your Docusaurus site locally, and you can view your site at http:// localhost:3000 in your browser.

5. Then you can modify the md files in /docs with any markdown editor you like, such as Typora, and you can commit pull requests.
