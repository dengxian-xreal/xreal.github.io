Please note that Nebula will no longer be maintained. For developers who wish to continue developing with Android phones, we provide Control Glasses as a server to perform OTA updates and launch 3D applications on XREAL glasses. For Android phone compatibility, we will limit our testing to Samsung flagship models only. Currently, SDK 2.4.1 is compatible with Samsung S24.
