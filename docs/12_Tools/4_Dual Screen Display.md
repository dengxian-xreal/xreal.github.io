# Dual Screen Display

### Introduction

When the AR app is put into the background, the view inside the glasses still shows the AR application, while the phone screen switches to the desktop and can open any 2D app. In other words, the main screen (phone screen) and secondary screen (glasses screen) display different application views.

### Usage

Developers can decide whether to turn on this function through the option `supportMultiResume` in `NRProjectConfig`, which is turned on by default. After turning on this function, the user needs to turn on a permission to use the application for the first time.
